# 📍 Dijkstra's Algorithm Applied to Buildings R, K, and L at UNTAR
This project is a final assignment for the **Data Structures course**, implementing **Dijkstra's Algorithm** in **Java** to calculate the shortest path between rooms in Buildings **R, K, and L** at **Universitas Tarumanagara (UNTAR)**.

## 🧠 Project Description

- **Nodes** represent rooms or key points in the buildings.
- **Edges** represent hallways, stairs, or connectors between rooms, with weights representing distance (in meters).

## 🏢 Buildings Covered
- **Building R**
- **Building K**
- **Building L**

Graph Algorithm: Dijkstra’s Algorithm

## 📚 Use Case
Helps new students, staff, or guests navigate the multi-building layout of UNTAR by calculating the shortest route from one room to another.
